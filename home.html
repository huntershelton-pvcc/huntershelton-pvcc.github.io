                <td>The DOE is a major sponsor of scientific research across various fields, including physics, chemistry, biology, and computer science. It operates a network of national laboratories, which conduct cutting-edge research in areas such as climate change, renewable energy technologies, and advanced materials. These laboratories also play a vital role in national security- for example, the Department of Energy's (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is responsible for the United States' nuclear weapons program. The DOE works to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and materials. In regards to clean energy, the DoE promotes the development and deployment of renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and geothermal power, and encourages energy efficiency through policies such as financial incentives, building codes, and applicance standards. Renewable energy research involving bioenergy, which is exploring ways to produce biofuels from renewable biomass in order to wean ourselves off of traditional fossil fuels. Also, the DoE has an extensive network of laboratories and advanced supercomputers, which allows the DoE to participate in a wide variety of advanced scientific research. A wide variety of topics are researched and funded by the Department of Energy; even those which may not seem pertinent to energy at first glance. Space vehicles use radioisotope power systems maintained and developed by the Department of Energy.<br>The Department of Energy has many surprising sides to its research and development teams, and the organization is determined to collaborate with many fields in order to advance energy production, energy efficiency, and energy sustainability. The DOE's investments in energy research and development have a significant impact on the U.S. economy. By supporting innovation and developing advancements in technology, the DoE helps to create jobs and drive economic growth.</td>
